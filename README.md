## About Night Moves

Night Moves is a simple mobile app that helps people make money while they sleep by turning their charging phone into a money-making machine. The entire process is just: download one app, copy/paste twice, and start earning overnight.

This application is part of the broader **XMRT DAO ecosystem** and **MobileMonero.com** initiative, providing a user-friendly gateway to mobile Monero mining and the decentralized autonomous organization powered by real-world Monero mining revenue.

## Core Concept

Your phone charges every night anyway. Night Moves turns that charging time into earning time. No complicated setup, no technical knowledge needed - just plug in your phone before bed and wake up with money in your pocket.

## How It Works

1. **Download Termux** - A free terminal app (auto-detects iPhone/Android)
2. **Install Python** - Copy/paste: `pkg install python`
3. **Start Earning** - Copy/paste the earnings script and you're done!

## Features

- **Super Simple Setup** - Just 3 easy steps
- **Mobile-First Design** - Optimized for phones
- **Night Theme** - Easy on the eyes for bedtime setup
- **Real-Time Progress** - Track your setup progress
- **Copy/Paste Interface** - No typing required
- **XMRT DAO Integration** - Connect to the broader Monero ecosystem
- **Passive Income** - Earn while you sleep
