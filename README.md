# Night Moves - Make Money While You Sleep

## About Night Moves

Night Moves is a simple mobile app that helps people make money while they sleep by turning their charging phone into a money-making machine. The entire process is just: download one app, copy/paste twice, and start earning overnight.

## Core Concept

Your phone charges every night anyway. Night Moves turns that charging time into earning time. No complicated setup, no technical knowledge needed - just plug in your phone before bed and wake up with money in your pocket.

## How It Works

1. **Download Termux** - A free terminal app (auto-detects iPhone/Android)
2. **Install Python** - Copy/paste: `pkg install python`
3. **Start Earning** - Copy/paste the earnings script and you're done!
